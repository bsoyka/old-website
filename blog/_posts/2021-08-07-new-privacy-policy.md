excerpt:
  Even though I'm no big company, I have a privacy policy now! Here's why and
  where you can find it.
---

While I’m not some big organization, I’ve decided it’s time for me to be more
open about my privacy practices. I have created a new privacy policy detailing
what information I collect from my users, how it’s used, and who I share it
with.

Any time I collect your information, it will be in accordance with this policy,
which even has a public revision history.

**[View it now on GitHub.](https://github.com/bsoyka/policy/blob/main/privacy-policy.md)**

If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I’m doing this to be more open
about how I handle your data, and I’m happy to share more information.
