I added a new susbcription form to my website. It's a simple form that you can
use to sign up: just enter your email and complete a captcha!

Also, thank you to some of the awesome
[Python Discord](https://www.pythondiscord.com/) staff for helping me test this
out, especially [Gustav](https://twitter.com/gustavodinger) and
[Dawn](https://twitter.com/dawnofmidnight_)!

I hope that this form will be an effective way to bring new members in to my
newsletter so I can share more about what I'm up to.
