  My blog has switched to a custom website! See why I'm switching to Jekyll.

My blog has moved! The URL is still the same, but I've switched over to a custom
website rather than Medium.

This new blog site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), written in
Markdown, and hosted with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
This allows me to keep the style consistent with my website and track changes to
my posts with Git.

As a downside, my posts won't reach my audience directly through Medium anymore,
but I feel that won't make much of a difference.

However, I'm excited to have more control over my content and my blog as a
whole!
